# welcome to the accent vault...
1. Explore the **periodic notes templates** : 
    - In collapsible callouts for daily, weekly and monthly notes, record your `sleep, gratitude, highlights, lessons learned and next plans` in the note's frontmatter. 
    - using the meta bind embed callouts, navigate around the periodic notes
    - insert memorable banners from your Google photos.
2. the **vault folder structure** is fairly simple and flat : 
    - `10 Sources` : like literature notes or clippings 
    - `20 My` : one's own personal space for reflective writing, journals, home and people.
    - `30 Notes` : one's own notes for sharing
    - `40 projects` : a space for specific projects
    - `00 Meta` : for getting oriented, exploring your vault using datascopes, storing attachments, and other plugin dependencies (e.g. templates, meta bind embeds)
3. Explore the vault with the **Quickadd** plugin
    - use the hotkey `ctrl + shift + Q` or via commander buttons in the top right of the tab bar
    - **perform actions** (e.g. add tasks or bullet points to daily notes, or add shopping items, reflections), or 
    - **navigate the vault** (periodic notes, home, tasks, invoke the global note template)
4. Use the **Global Note Template** to organise your notes
    - access the GNT via hotkeys (`alt + F` or `alt + shift + F` create new note) or via the commander buttons in the top right of the tab bar 
    - create and organise notes by `type` (recipe, project, book, film, person notes...)
