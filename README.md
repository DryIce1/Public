> [!NOTE]+ # Welcome to ***the accent vault...***
> 1. Explore the **periodic notes templates** : 
>     - In collapsible callouts for daily, weekly and monthly notes, record your `sleep, gratitude, highlights, lessons learned and next plans` in the note's frontmatter. 
>     - using the meta bind embed callouts, navigate around the periodic notes
>     - insert memorable banners from your Google photos.
> 2. the **vault folder structure** is fairly simple and flat : 
>     - `10 Sources` : like literature notes or clippings 
>     - `20 My` : one's own personal space for reflective writing, journals, home and people.
>     - `30 Notes` : one's own notes for sharing
>     - `40 projects` : a space for specific projects
>     - `00 Meta` : for getting oriented, exploring your vault using datascopes, storing attachments, and other plugin dependencies (e.g. templates, meta bind embeds)
> 3. Explore the vault with the **Quickadd** plugin
>     - use the hotkey `ctrl + shift + Q` or via commander buttons in the top right of the tab bar
>     - **perform actions** (e.g. add tasks or bullet points to daily notes, or add shopping items, reflections), or 
>     - **navigate the vault** (periodic notes, home, tasks, invoke the global note template)
> 4. Use the **Global Note Template** to organise your notes
>     - access the GNT via hotkeys (`alt + F` or `alt + shift + F` create new note) or via the commander buttons in the top right of the tab bar 
>     - create and organise notes by `type` (recipe, project, book, film, person notes...)
> 5. Explore included **datascopes**
